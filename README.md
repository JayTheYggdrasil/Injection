# Injection - a framework and a game.
This project is a combination of game and framework. The goal is to create a framework that allows rapid prototyping of game mechanics through the use of functional programming.

The game is an implementation of: https://eastvillage.itch.io/the-area-where-you-cant-place-arrows a fantastic game made by a friend.

Typically Functional Programming isn't used in games very often, but here's a few reasons as to why I'm taking this approach.
- The first biggest reason is just to learn about and gain experience with Functional Programming.
- The second reason is that it allows for a rather easy way to manipulate time, whether that be to create an undo button, or see into the future. This is because old gamestates are not destroyed in the process of creating new ones.
- The third reason is that Functional Programming lends itself quite well to the ideas of data driven design which has become quite common in game dev.
